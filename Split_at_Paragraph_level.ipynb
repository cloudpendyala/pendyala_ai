The president directs the\\nexecutive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of\\nthe United States Armed Forces.\\nThe power of the presidency has grown substantially[12] since the first\\npresident, George Washington, took office in 1789.[6] While presidential power\\nhas ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly\\nsignificant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th\\ncentury, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the\\npresidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush.[13][14] In modern\\ntimes, the president is one of the world\\'s most powerful political figures and\\nthe leader of the world\\'s only remaining superpower.[15][16][17][18] As the leader\\nof the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president\\npossesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power. For\\nmuch of the 20th century, especially during the Cold War, the U.S. president\\nwas often called \"the leader of the free world\".[19]\\nArticle II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal\\ngovernment and vests executive power in the president. The power includes\\nthe execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint\\nfederal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers. Based on\\nconstitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive\\nambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent\\nlaws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility\\nfor conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing\\nthe world\\'s most expensive military, which has the second-largest nuclear\\narsenal.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic\\npolicymaking. As part of the system of separation of powers, Article I, Section\\xa07\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal\\nlegislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their\\npolitical parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of\\npresidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their\\npolicy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent\\non the president.[20] In recent decades, presidents have also made increasing\\nuse of executive orders, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape\\ndomestic policy.\\nThe president is elected indirectly through the Electoral College to a four-year\\nterm, along with the vice president. Under the Twenty-second Amendment,\\nratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may\\nbe elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president\\n', \"Head of\\ngovernment\\nCommander-in-\\nchief\\nAbbreviation\\nPOTUS\\nMember of\\nCabinet\\nDomestic Policy\\nCouncil\\nNational Economic\\nCouncil\\nNational Security\\nCouncil\\nResidence\\nWhite House\\nSeat\\nWashington, D.C.\\nAppointer\\nElectoral College\\nor via succession\\nTerm length\\nFour years,\\nrenewable once\\nConstituting\\ninstrument\\nConstitution of the\\nUnited States\\nFormation\\nMarch\\xa04,\\n1789[6][7][8]\\nFirst holder\\nGeorge\\nWashington[9]\\nSalary\\n$400,000 per\\nyear[A]\\nWebsite\\nwww.whitehouse\\n.gov (https://www.w\\nhitehouse.gov/)\\nby virtue of a president's intra-term death or resignation.[C] In all, 45\\nindividuals have served 46 presidencies spanning 58 four-year terms.[D] Joe\\nBiden is the 46th and current president of the United States, having assumed\\noffice on January 20, 2021.\\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies, represented\\nby the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, declared themselves to be\\nindependent sovereign states and no longer under British rule. The affirmation\\nwas made in the Declaration of Independence, which was written\\npredominantly by Thomas Jefferson and adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776,\\nby the Second Continental Congress.[22] Recognizing the necessity of closely\\ncoordinating their efforts against the British,[23] the Continental Congress\\nsimultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates together. There were long debates on a number of issues, including\\nrepresentation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central\\ngovernment.[24] Congress finished work on the Articles of Confederation to\\nestablish a perpetual union between the states in November 1777 and sent it to\\nthe states for ratification.[22]\\nUnder the Articles, which took effect on March 1, 1781, the Congress of the\\nConfederation was a central political authority without any legislative power. It\\ncould make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any\\nlaws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations\\nupon its citizens.[23] This institutional design reflected how Americans\\nbelieved the deposed British system of Crown and Parliament ought to have\\nfunctioned with respect to the royal dominion: a superintending body for\\nmatters that concerned the entire empire.[23] The states were out from under\\nany monarchy and assigned some formerly royal prerogatives (e.g., making\\nwar, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were\\nlodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a president of the United\\nStates in Congress Assembled to preside over its deliberation as a neutral discussion moderator. Unrelated to and\\nquite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position without\\nmuch influence.[25]\\nIn 1783, the Treaty of Paris secured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states\\neach turned toward their own internal affairs.[22] By 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and\\nweak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They\\nwitnessed their hard currency pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their Mediterranean commerce\\npreyed upon by North African pirates, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing\\ninterest.[22] Civil and political unrest loomed. Events such as the Newburgh Conspiracy and Shays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between Virginia and Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference in 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September\\n1786 in Annapolis, Maryland, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms.\\nWhen the convention failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states, Alexander\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\n\", \"George Washington, the first\\npresident of the United States\\nHamilton led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next\\nspring in Philadelphia. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until James Madison and Edmund\\nRandolph succeeded in securing George Washington's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.[22][26]\\nWhen the Constitutional Convention convened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (Rhode Island\\ndid not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional\\narrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most\\nstates maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a\\nsingle term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.[22] New York\\noffered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a\\nthree-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.[22] It was through the\\nclosed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the U.S. Constitution emerged.\\nAs the nation's first president, George Washington established many norms\\nthat would come to define the office.[27][28] His decision to retire after two\\nterms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy,[29]\\nand established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would\\neventually be made permanent by the Twenty-Second Amendment. By the end\\nof his presidency, political parties had developed,[30] with John Adams\\ndefeating Thomas Jefferson in 1796, the first truly contested presidential\\nelection.[31] After Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow\\nVirginians James Madison and James Monroe would each serve two terms,\\neventually dominating the nation's politics during the Era of Good Feelings\\nuntil Adams' son John Quincy Adams won election in 1824 after the\\nDemocratic-Republican Party split.\\nThe election of Andrew Jackson in 1828 was a significant milestone, as Jackson\\nwas not part of the Virginia and Massachusetts elite that had held the\\npresidency for its first 40 years.[32] Jacksonian democracy sought to strengthen\\nthe presidency at the expense of Congress, while broadening public\\nparticipation as the nation rapidly expanded westward. However, his successor, Martin Van Buren, became\\nunpopular after the Panic of 1837,[33] and the death of William Henry Harrison and subsequent poor relations\\nbetween John Tyler and Congress led to further weakening of the office.[34] Including Van Buren, in the 24 years\\nbetween 1837 and 1861, six presidential terms would be filled by eight different men, with none serving two\\nterms.[35] The Senate played an important role during this period, with the Great Triumvirate of Henry Clay,\\nDaniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun playing key roles in shaping national policy in the 1830s and 1840s until\\ndebates over slavery began pulling the nation apart in the 1850s.[36][37]\\nAbraham Lincoln's leadership during the Civil War has led historians to regard him as one of the nation's greatest\\npresidents.[E] The circumstances of the war and Republican domination of Congress made the office very\\npowerful,[38][39] and Lincoln's re-election in 1864 was the first time a president had been re-elected since Jackson\\nin 1832. After Lincoln's assassination, his successor Andrew Johnson lost all political support[40] and was nearly\\nremoved from office,[41] with Congress remaining powerful during the two-term presidency of Civil War general\\nUlysses S. Grant. After the end of Reconstruction, Grover Cleveland would eventually become the first Democratic\\npresident elected since before the war, running in three consecutive elections (1884, 1888, 1892) and winning\\ntwice. In 1900, William McKinley became the first incumbent to win re-election since Grant in 1872.\\n1789–1933\\n\", 'President Franklin D. Roosevelt\\ndelivers a radio address in 1933.\\nAfter McKinley\\'s assassination by Leon Czolgosz in 1901, Theodore Roosevelt became a dominant figure in\\nAmerican politics.[42] Historians believe Roosevelt permanently changed the political system by strengthening the\\npresidency,[43] with some key accomplishments including breaking up trusts, conservationism, labor reforms,\\nmaking personal character as important as the issues, and hand-picking his successor, William Howard Taft. The\\nfollowing decade, Woodrow Wilson led the nation to victory during World War I, although Wilson\\'s proposal for\\nthe League of Nations was rejected by the Senate.[44] Warren Harding, while popular in office, would see his legacy\\ntarnished by scandals, especially Teapot Dome,[45] and Herbert Hoover quickly became very unpopular after\\nfailing to alleviate the Great Depression.[46]\\nThe ascendancy of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 led further toward what\\nhistorians now describe as the Imperial presidency.[47] Backed by enormous\\nDemocratic majorities in Congress and public support for major change,\\nRoosevelt\\'s New Deal dramatically increased the size and scope of the federal\\ngovernment, including more executive agencies.[48]:\\u200a\\n211–12\\u200a The traditionally\\nsmall presidential staff was greatly expanded, with the Executive Office of the\\nPresident \\nbeing \\ncreated \\nin \\n1939, \\nnone \\nof \\nwhom \\nrequire \\nSenate\\nconfirmation.[48]:\\u200a\\n229–231\\u200a Roosevelt\\'s unprecedented re-election to a third and\\nfourth term, the victory of the United States in World War II, and the nation\\'s\\ngrowing economy all helped established the office as a position of global\\nleadership.[48]:\\u200a\\n269\\u200a His successors, Harry Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower,\\neach served two terms as the Cold War led the presidency to be viewed as the\\n\"leader of the free world\",[49] while John F. Kennedy was a youthful and popular leader who benefited from the rise\\nof television in the 1960s.[50][51]\\nAfter Lyndon B. Johnson lost popular support due to the Vietnam War and Richard Nixon\\'s presidency collapsed\\nin the Watergate scandal, Congress enacted a series of reforms intended to reassert itself.[52][53] These included the\\nWar Powers Resolution, enacted over Nixon\\'s veto in 1973,[54][55] and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment\\nControl Act of 1974 that sought to strengthen congressional fiscal powers.[56] By 1976, Gerald Ford conceded that\\n\"the historic pendulum\" had swung toward Congress, raising the possibility of a \"disruptive\" erosion of his ability\\nto govern.[57] Ford failed to win election to a full term and his successor, Jimmy Carter, failed to win re-election.\\nRonald Reagan, who had been an actor before beginning his political career, used his talent as a communicator to\\nhelp reshape the American agenda away from New Deal policies toward more conservative ideology.[58][59]\\nWith the Cold War ending and the United States becoming the world\\'s undisputed leading power,[60] Bill Clinton,\\nGeorge W. Bush, and Barack Obama each served two terms as president. Meanwhile, Congress and the nation\\ngradually became more politically polarized, especially following the 1994 mid-term elections that saw Republicans\\ncontrol the House for the first time in 40 years, and the rise of routine filibusters in the Senate in recent\\ndecades.[61] Recent presidents have thus increasingly focused on executive orders, agency regulations, and judicial\\nappointments to implement major policies, at the expense of legislation and congressional power.[62] Presidential\\nelections in the 21st century have reflected this continuing polarization, with no candidate except Obama in 2008\\nwinning by more than five percent of the popular vote and two, George W. Bush and Donald Trump, winning in the\\nElectoral College while losing the popular vote.[F]\\nThe nation\\'s Founding Fathers expected the Congress, which was the first branch of government described in the\\nConstitution, to be the dominant branch of government; however, they did not expect a strong executive\\ndepartment.[63] However, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in claims that the modern\\nImperial presidency\\nCritics of presidency\\'s evolution\\n', 'President Lyndon B. Johnson signs\\nthe 1964 Civil Rights Act at the\\nWhite House on July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr. and others\\nlook on.\\npresidency has become too powerful,[64][65] unchecked, unbalanced,[66] and \"monarchist\" in nature.[67] In 2008\\nprofessor Dana D. Nelson expressed belief that presidents over the previous thirty years worked towards\\n\"undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies\".[68] She criticized proponents of the\\nUnitary executive theory for expanding \"the many existing uncheckable executive powers—such as executive\\norders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements—\\nthat already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid, interference or\\nconsent from Congress\".[68] Bill Wilson, board member of Americans for Limited Government, opined that the\\nexpanded presidency was \"the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule\".[69]\\nArticle I, Section\\xa01 of the Constitution vests all lawmaking power in Congress\\'s hands, and Article 1, Section 6,\\nClause\\xa02 prevents the president (and all other executive branch officers) from simultaneously being a member of\\nCongress. Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional\\nprovisions and historical developments over time.\\nThe president\\'s most significant legislative power derives from the Presentment\\nClause, which gives the president the power to veto any bill passed by Congress.\\nWhile Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a two-thirds vote of\\nboth houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely\\nsupported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that\\nCongress would seek to increase its power and enable a \"tyranny of the\\nmajority\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an\\nimportant check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed\\nthe veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is\\nnow routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a\\nbill. The veto – or threat of a veto – has thus evolved to make the modern\\npresidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by\\nCongress, the president has three options:\\n1. Sign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill becomes law.\\n2. Veto the legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated,\\nexpressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the\\nveto by a two-thirds vote.\\n3. Take no action on the legislation within the above timeframe—the bill becomes law, as if the president had\\nsigned it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president\\'s veto power with the Line Item Veto Act. The legislation\\nempowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items\\nwithin the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax\\nbenefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress\\ncould override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In Clinton v. City of New York, 524\\nU.S. 417 (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/524/417/) (1998), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled such a\\nlegislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nLegislative powers\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nSetting the agenda\\n', 'President Donald Trump delivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore Congress.\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on\\nthe basis of a promised legislative agenda. Article II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the\\npresident deems \"necessary and expedient\". This is done through the\\nconstitutionally-based State of the Union address, which usually outlines the\\npresident\\'s legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal\\nand informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting,\\nor even insisting that Congress enact laws he believes are needed. Additionally,\\nhe can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting\\ninfluence on individual members of Congress.[70] Presidents possess this power\\nbecause the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members\\nof Congress can introduce legislation.[71]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or\\nrepresentatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress\\nalter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.[72]\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate\\npowers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control\\na vast array of agencies that can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to\\nCongress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \"virtual army of\\n\\'czars\\'—each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White\\nHouse\".[73] Presidents have been criticized for making signing statements when signing congressional legislation\\nabout how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.[74] This practice has been criticized by the American Bar\\nAssociation as unconstitutional.[75] Conservative commentator George Will wrote of an \"increasingly swollen\\nexecutive branch\" and \"the eclipse of Congress\".[76]\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is\\nnot in session, the president is empowered by Article II, Section\\xa03 of the Constitution to call a special session of one\\nor both houses of Congress. Since John Adams first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to\\nconvene for a special session on 27 occasions. Harry S. Truman was the most recent to do so in July 1948, known\\nas the Turnip Day Session. In addition, prior to ratification of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933, which brought\\nforward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly inaugurated presidents would\\nroutinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into\\ndisuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions\\nevery three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress\\nif the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this\\npower.[77][78]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nExecutive powers\\n', 'Suffice it to say that the\\nPresident is made the\\nsole repository of the\\nexecutive powers of the\\nUnited States, and the\\npowers entrusted to him\\nas well as the duties\\nimposed upon him are\\nawesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

An incoming president may make up to\\n4,000 upon taking office, 1200 of which must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\\nAmbassadors, members of the Cabinet, and various officers, are among the\\npositions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation.[81][82]\\nThe power of a president to fire executive officials has long been a contentious\\npolitical issue. Generally, a president may remove executive officials at will.[83]\\nHowever, Congress can curtail and constrain a president\\'s authority to fire\\ncommissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive\\nofficers by statute.[84]\\nTo manage the growing federal bureaucracy, presidents have gradually surrounded\\nthemselves with many layers of staff, who were eventually organized into the\\nExecutive Office of the President of the United States. Within the Executive Office,\\nthe president\\'s innermost layer of aides, and their assistants, are located in the\\nWhite House Office.\\nThe president also possesses the power to manage operations of the federal government by issuing various types of\\ndirectives, such as presidential proclamation and executive orders. When the president is lawfully exercising one of\\nthe constitutionally conferred presidential responsibilities, the scope of this power is broad.[85] Even so, these\\ndirectives are subject to judicial review by U.S. federal courts, which can find them to be unconstitutional. Congress\\ncan overturn an executive order through legislation.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 4 requires the president to \"receive Ambassadors.\"\\nThis clause, known as the Reception Clause, has been interpreted to imply that\\nthe president possesses broad power over matters of foreign policy,[86] and to\\nprovide support for the president\\'s exclusive authority to grant recognition to a\\nforeign government.[87] The Constitution also empowers the president to\\nappoint United States ambassadors, and to propose and chiefly negotiate\\nagreements between the United States and other countries. Such agreements,\\nupon receiving the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate (by a two-thirds\\nmajority vote), become binding with the force of federal law.\\nWhile foreign affairs has always been a significant element of presidential\\nresponsibilities, advances in technology since the Constitution\\'s adoption have\\nincreased presidential power. Where formerly ambassadors were vested with\\nsignificant power to independently negotiate on behalf of the United States, presidents now routinely meet directly\\nwith leaders of foreign countries.\\nAdministrative powers\\nForeign affairs\\nCommander-in-chief\\n', 'Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president\\nwho successfully preserved the\\nUnion during the American Civil\\nWar, with Union Army general\\nGeorge B.

The power to declare\\nwar is constitutionally vested in Congress, but the president has ultimate\\nresponsibility for the direction and disposition of the military. The exact degree\\nof authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander-in-\\nchief has been the subject of much debate throughout history, with Congress at\\nvarious times granting the president wide authority and at others attempting to\\nrestrict that authority.[88] The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the\\npresident\\'s powers regarding the military; Alexander Hamilton explained this\\nin Federalist No. 69:\\nThe President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the\\nUnited States.\\xa0... It would amount to nothing more than the supreme\\ncommand and direction of the military and naval forces\\xa0... while that\\n[the power] of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and\\nto the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all [of]\\nwhich\\xa0 ... would appertain to the legislature.[89] [Emphasis in the\\noriginal.]\\nIn the modern era, pursuant to the War Powers Resolution, Congress must\\nauthorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that\\nhave never been employed, rendering it ineffectual.[90] Additionally, Congress provides a check to presidential\\nmilitary power through its control over military spending and regulation. Presidents have historically initiated the\\nprocess for going to war,[91][92] but critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents\\ndid not get official declarations, including Theodore Roosevelt\\'s military move into Panama in 1903,[91] the Korean\\nWar,[91] the Vietnam War,[91] and the invasions of Grenada in 1983[93] and Panama in 1989.[94]\\nThe amount of military detail handled personally by the president in wartime has varied greatly.[95] George\\nWashington, the first U.S. president, firmly established military subordination under civilian authority. In 1794,\\nWashington used his constitutional powers to assemble 12,000 militia to quell the Whiskey Rebellion, a conflict in\\nWestern Pennsylvania involving armed farmers and distillers who refused to pay an excise tax on spirits. According\\nto historian Joseph Ellis, this was the \"first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field\",\\nthough James Madison briefly took control of artillery units in defense of Washington, D.C., during the War of\\n1812.[96] Abraham Lincoln was deeply involved in overall strategy and in day-to-day operations during the\\nAmerican Civil War, 1861–1865; historians have given Lincoln high praise for his strategic sense and his ability to\\nselect and encourage commanders such as Ulysses S. Grant.[97]\\nThe present-day operational command of the Armed Forces is delegated to the Department of Defense and is\\nnormally exercised through the secretary of defense. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant\\nCommands assist with the operation as outlined in the presidentially approved Unified Command Plan\\n(UCP).[98][99][100]\\nproduces:\\nThe president has the power to nominate federal judges, including members of the United States courts of appeals\\nand the Supreme Court of the United States. However, these nominations require Senate confirmation before they\\nmay take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the\\nfederal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance.

Presidents may\\nalso grant pardons and reprieves. Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon a\\nmonth after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving\\noffice, like when Bill Clinton pardoned Patty Hearst on his last day in office;\\nthis is often controversial.[101][102][103]\\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the\\npresident to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is\\nexecutive privilege, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any\\ncommunications made directly to the president in the performance of executive\\nduties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested\\nto see Chief Justice John Jay's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law,\\nWashington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried\\nto use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence\\nto Congress during the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in United\\nStates v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/418/683/) (1974), that executive\\nprivilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton\\nattempted to use executive privilege regarding the Lewinsky scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in Clinton v. Jones,\\n520 U.S. 681 (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/520/681/) (1997), that the privilege also could not be\\nused in civil suits. These cases established the legal precedent that executive privilege is valid, although the exact\\nextent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to\\nradiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those\\nexecutive branch communications that do not involve the president.[104]\\nThe state secrets privilege allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents\\nfrom discovery in legal proceedings if such release would harm national security. Precedent for the privilege arose\\nearly in the 19th century when Thomas Jefferson refused to release military documents in the treason trial of Aaron\\nBurr and again in Totten v. United States 92 U.S. 105 (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/92/105/)\\n(1876), when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.[105] However, the privilege was\\nnot formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until United States v. Reynolds 345 U.S. 1 (https://supreme.jus\\ntia.com/cases/federal/us/345/1/) (1953), where it was held to be a common law evidentiary privilege.[106] Before\\nthe September 11 attacks, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.[107] Since 2001, the\\ngovernment has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances\\ncausing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Mohamed\\nv. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.[106][108][109] Critics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government\\nto cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.[110][111]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has absolute immunity from court cases is contested and has been the\\nsubject of several Supreme Court decisions. Nixon v. Fitzgerald (1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then\\nformer president Richard Nixon based on his official actions. Clinton v. Jones (1997) decided that a president has\\nno immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit\\ncould proceed without delay, even against a sitting president.

As of October\\n2019, a case was pending in the federal courts regarding access to personal tax returns in a criminal case brought\\nagainst Donald Trump by the New York County District Attorney alleging violations of New York state law.[112]\\nAs head of state, the president represents the United States\\ngovernment to its own people and represents the nation to the rest\\nof the world. For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of\\nstate, the president typically hosts a State Arrival Ceremony held on\\nthe South Lawn, a custom begun by John F. Kennedy in 1961.[113]\\nThis is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is\\nheld in the State Dining Room later in the evening.[114]\\nAs a national leader, the president also fulfills many less formal ceremonial\\nduties. For example, William Howard Taft started the tradition of throwing out\\nthe ceremonial first pitch in 1910 at Griffith Stadium, Washington, D.C., on the\\nWashington Senators\\'s Opening Day. Every president since Taft, except for\\nJimmy Carter, threw out at least one ceremonial first ball or pitch for Opening\\nDay, the All-Star Game, or the World Series, usually with much fanfare.[115]\\nEvery president since Theodore Roosevelt has served as honorary president of\\nthe Boy Scouts of America.[116]\\nOther presidential traditions are associated with American holidays.\\nRutherford B. Hayes began in 1878 the first White House egg rolling for local\\nchildren.[117] Beginning in 1947, during the Harry S. Truman administration,\\nevery Thanksgiving the president is presented with a live domestic turkey\\nduring the annual National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation held at the\\nWhite House. Since 1989, when the custom of \"pardoning\" the turkey was\\nformalized by George H. W. Bush, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it\\nwill live out the rest of its natural life.[118]\\nPresidential traditions also involve the president\\'s role as head of government.\\nMany outgoing presidents since James Buchanan traditionally give advice to\\ntheir successor during the presidential transition.[119] Ronald Reagan and his\\nsuccessors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on\\nInauguration Day for the incoming president.[120]\\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation\\'s premier celebrities. Some argue that images of\\nthe presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration public relations officials as well as by\\npresidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \"propagandized leadership\" which has a\\n\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\".[121] Administration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops of smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.[122] One critic wrote the image of John\\nF. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \"in rich detail\" which \"drew on the power of myth\" regarding the\\nincident of PT 109[123] and wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential\\nLeadership roles\\nHead of state\\n1:00\\n', 'ambitions.[124] As a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic\\nexpectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world,\\ncomfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\".[125]\\nThe president is typically considered to be the head of their political party. Since the entire House of\\nRepresentatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a\\npolitical party inevitably have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party\\'s presidential\\ncandidate. The coattail effect, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party\\'s candidates at state and local levels of\\ngovernment as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents\\nwho lose significant support from their party\\'s caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.\\nWith the rise of the United States as a superpower in the 20th century, and the United States having the world\\'s\\nlargest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world\\'s\\nmost powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of NATO, and the country\\'s\\nstrong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the European Union, have led\\nto the moniker that the president is the \"leader of the free world\".\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as\\npresident, one must:\\nbe a natural-born citizen of the United States;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a resident in the United States for at least 14 years.[126]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of\\npresident under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder Article I, Section 3, Clause 7, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further\\npublic office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the\\npresidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.[127][128]\\nUnder Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and\\nlater rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted\\nby a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.[129] There is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as\\nwritten allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of\\nCongress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of\\nexcluding Confederates from public office after the Civil War.[130]\\nUnder the Twenty-second Amendment, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment\\nalso specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a\\nterm for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president\\nonce.[131][132]\\nHead of party\\nGlobal leader\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nCampaigns and nomination\\n', \"President Jimmy Carter (left)\\ndebates Republican nominee\\nRonald Reagan on October 28,\\n1980, during the 1980 U.S.\\npresidential campaign.\\nMap of the United States showing\\nthe number of electoral votes\\nallocated to each state and the\\nDistrict of Columbia following the\\n2010 census for the 2012, 2016,\\nand 2020 presidential elections;\\nMaine and Nebraska distribute\\nelectors by way of the congressional\\ndistrict method.

Typically, the party's presidential candidate\\nchooses a vice presidential nominee, and this choice is rubber-stamped by the\\nconvention. The most common previous profession of presidents is lawyer.[133]\\nNominees participate in nationally televised debates, and while the debates are\\nusually restricted to the Democratic and Republican nominees, third party\\ncandidates may be invited, such as Ross Perot in the 1992 debates. Nominees\\ncampaign across the country to explain their views, convince voters and solicit\\ncontributions. Much of the modern electoral process is concerned with winning\\nswing states through frequent visits and mass media advertising drives.\\nThe president is elected indirectly by the voters of each state and the District of\\nColumbia through the Electoral College, a body of electors formed every four\\nyears for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president to\\nconcurrent four-year terms. As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2,\\neach state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total\\ndelegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the Twenty-third\\nAmendment provides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it\\nwould have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous\\nstate.[134] Currently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors\\nbased on a popular election.[135] In all but two states, the party whose\\npresidential–vice presidential ticket receives a plurality of popular votes in the\\nstate has its entire slate of elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.[136]\\nMaine and Nebraska deviate from this winner-take-all practice, awarding two\\nelectors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional\\ndistrict.[137][138]\\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks\\nafter the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in\\nWashington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the\\ncandidates of the party that nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring\\nthem to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates\\nto whom they are pledged.[139][140] The constitutionality of these laws was upheld in Chiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).[141] Following the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The\\nvotes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If\\na candidate has received an absolute majority of electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is\\ndeclared the winner. Otherwise, the House of Representatives must meet to elect a president using a contingent\\nelection procedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose\\nbetween the top three electoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the\\nvotes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).[135]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73–73 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson and fellow Democratic-Republican Aaron Burr in the election of 1800 necessitated the first.\\nConducted under the original procedure established by Article II, Section 1, Clause\\xa03 of the Constitution, which\\nstipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives\\nwould choose one of them for president; the runner-up would become vice president.[142] On February 17, 1801,\\nElection\\n\", 'President William McKinley and his\\nvice presidential running mate, New\\nYork Governor Theodore Roosevelt,\\nc.\\u20091900\\nJefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was\\noverhauled through the Twelfth Amendment in time to be used in the 1804 election.[143] A quarter-century later,\\nthe choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes\\n(131 of 261) in the election of 1824. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president\\nfrom among the top three electoral vote recipients: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and William H.\\nCrawford. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams\\nbeing elected president on the first ballot.[144]\\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president\\nbegins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election.[145] The first presidential\\nand vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as Inauguration Day, were the second terms of President\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner in 1937.[146] Previously, Inauguration Day was on\\nMarch 4. As a result of the date change, the first term (1933–37) of both men had been shortened by 43 days.[147]\\nBefore executing the powers of the office, a president is required to recite the presidential Oath of Office, found in\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\xa0 8 of the Constitution. This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony\\nmandated by the Constitution:\\nI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States,\\nand will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.[148]\\nPresidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a Bible while taking the oath, and have added \"So help me\\nGod\" to the end of the oath.[149][150] Although the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to\\nadminister oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the chief justice of the United States.[148]\\nWhen the first president, George Washington, announced in his Farewell\\nAddress that he was not running for a third term, he established a \"two terms\\nthen out\" precedent. Precedent became tradition after Thomas Jefferson\\npublicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did\\nhis two immediate successors, James Madison and James Monroe.[151] In spite\\nof the strong two-term tradition, Ulysses S. Grant sought nomination at the\\n1880 Republican National Convention for a non-consecutive third term, but\\nwas unsuccessful.[152]\\nIn 1940, after leading the nation through the Great Depression and focused on\\nsupporting U.S. allied nations at war with the Axis powers, Franklin Roosevelt\\nwas elected to a third term, breaking the long-standing precedent. Four years\\nlater, with the U.S. engaged in World War II, he was re-elected again despite\\nhis declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12,\\n1945.[153]\\nIn response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt\\'s presidency, the Twenty-second Amendment was adopted in\\n1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served\\nmore than two years (24 months) of another president\\'s four-year term. Harry S. Truman, the president at the time\\nInauguration\\nIncumbency\\nTerm limit\\n', 'Franklin D. Roosevelt won a record\\nfour presidential elections in 1932,\\n1936, 1940, and 1944 prior to the\\nimplementation of the 22nd\\namendment in 1951, which\\ninstituted a two-term limit.\\nit was submitted to the states by the Congress, was exempted from its\\nlimitations. Without the exemption, he would not have been eligible to run for a\\nsecond full term in 1952 (which he briefly sought), as he had served nearly all of\\nFranklin Roosevelt\\'s unexpired 1945–1949 term and had been elected to a full\\nfour-year term beginning in 1949.[153] Since becoming operative in 1951, the\\namendment has been applicable to six twice-elected presidents: Dwight D.\\nEisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and\\nBarack Obama.\\nUnder Section\\xa0 1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, ratified in 1967, the vice\\npresident becomes president upon the removal from office, death, or\\nresignation of the president. Deaths have occurred a number of times,\\nresignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never\\noccurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the\\nmatter of succession), Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, stated only that the vice\\npresident assumes the \"powers and duties\" of the presidency in the event of a\\npresident\\'s removal, death, resignation, or inability.[154] Under this clause,\\nthere was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become\\npresident in the event of a vacancy, or simply act as president,[155] potentially\\nresulting in a special election. Upon the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841, Vice President John\\nTyler declared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \"Acting\\nPresident\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall\\nbecome acting president in the \"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice\\npresident\".[155] The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 (codified as 3\\xa0U.S.C.\\xa0§\\xa019 (https://www.law.cornell.edu/usc\\node/text/3/19)) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise\\nunavailable to serve during their terms of office, the presidential line of succession follows the order of: speaker of\\nthe House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments who form the president\\'s cabinet. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which\\nthe secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or\\nthe department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally\\nineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the\\npresidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.[156]\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to\\nthe vice president, who then becomes acting president, by transmitting to the speaker of the House and the\\npresident pro tempore of the Senate a statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes\\nhis or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been\\nused by Ronald Reagan (once), George W. Bush (twice), and Joe Biden (once), each in anticipation of\\nsurgery.[157][158]\\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment also provides that the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of\\nthe Cabinet, may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president by transmitting a written\\ndeclaration, to the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate, to the effect that the\\nVacancies and succession\\nDeclarations of inability\\n', 'Presidential pay history\\nYear\\nestablished\\nSalary\\nSalary in\\n2023 USD\\n1789\\n$25,000\\n$639,362\\n1873\\n$50,000\\n$1,271,667\\n1909\\n$75,000\\n$2,543,333\\n1949\\n$100,000\\n$1,280,559\\n1969\\n$200,000\\n$1,661,706\\n2001\\n$400,000\\n$688,292\\nSources:[162][163][164]\\npresident is unable to discharge his or her powers and duties.

Additionally, the House\\nJudiciary Committee conducted an impeachment inquiry against Richard Nixon in 1973–74 and reported three\\narticles of impeachment to the House of Representatives for final action; however, he resigned from office before\\nthe House voted on them.[159]\\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the\\npart of the president, or with a long-term disability. In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver\\nmessages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders.\\nThis has ranged from Richard Nixon\\'s Chief of Staff not transmitting orders to the Cabinet due to the president\\'s\\nheavy drinking, to staff removing memos from Donald Trump\\'s desk.[161] Decades before the Twenty-fifth\\nAmendment, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a stroke that left him partly incapacitated.

Bush Presidential\\nLibrary and Museum in Dallas in\\n2013\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret\\nService until the president\\'s death.[189][190] In 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection\\nto no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.[191] On January 10, 2013, President Obama signed\\nlegislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him, George W. Bush, and all subsequent\\npresidents.[192] A first spouse who remarries is no longer eligible for Secret Service protection.[191]\\nEvery president since Herbert Hoover has created a repository known as a\\npresidential library for preserving and making available his papers, records,\\nand other documents and materials. Completed libraries are deeded to and\\nmaintained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); the\\ninitial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private,\\nnon-federal sources.[193] There are currently thirteen presidential libraries in\\nthe NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state\\ngovernments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education,\\nincluding:\\nThe Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by the\\nState of Illinois;\\nThe George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by\\nSouthern Methodist University;\\nThe George H. W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by\\nTexas A&M University; and\\nThe Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by the University of Texas at\\nAustin.\\nSeveral former presidents have overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some even\\nmade arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the\\npresident they document:\\nThe Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri;\\nThe Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home in Abilene, Kansas;\\nThe Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California; and\\nThe Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, California.\\nThese gravesites are open to the general public.\\nPolitical parties have dominated American politics for most of the nation\\'s history. Though the Founding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S.\\nConstitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless.\\nThey evolved from political factions, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government\\ncame into existence. Those who supported the Washington administration were referred to as \"pro-administration\"\\nand would eventually form the Federalist Party, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging Democratic-\\nRepublican Party.[194]\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation\\ntogether, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year\\npresidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.[195][196] Since\\nWashington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office.[197][198]\\nPresidential libraries\\nPolitical affiliation\\n', 'The number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office\\n(alphabetical, by last name) are:\\nParty\\n#\\nName(s)\\nRepublican\\n19\\nChester\\xa0A.\\xa0Arthur, George\\xa0H.\\xa0W.\\xa0Bush, George\\xa0W.\\xa0Bush, Calvin\\xa0Coolidge, Dwight\\xa0D.\\xa0Eisenhower,\\nGerald\\xa0Ford, James\\xa0A.\\xa0Garfield, Ulysses\\xa0S.\\xa0Grant, Warren\\xa0G.\\xa0Harding, Benjamin\\xa0Harrison,\\nRutherford\\xa0B.\\xa0Hayes, Herbert\\xa0Hoover, Abraham\\xa0Lincoln,[G] William\\xa0McKinley, Richard\\xa0Nixon,\\nRonald\\xa0Reagan, Theodore\\xa0Roosevelt, William\\xa0Howard\\xa0Taft, and Donald\\xa0Trump\\nDemocratic\\n15\\nJoe Biden (incumbent), James\\xa0Buchanan, Jimmy\\xa0Carter, Grover\\xa0Cleveland, Bill\\xa0Clinton,\\nAndrew\\xa0Jackson, Lyndon\\xa0B.\\xa0Johnson, John\\xa0F.\\xa0Kennedy, Barack Obama, Franklin\\xa0Pierce, James\\xa0K.\\xa0Polk,\\nFranklin\\xa0D.\\xa0Roosevelt, Harry\\xa0S.\\xa0Truman, Martin\\xa0Van\\xa0Buren, and Woodrow\\xa0Wilson\\nDemocratic-\\nRepublican\\n4\\nJohn\\xa0Quincy\\xa0Adams, Thomas\\xa0Jefferson, James\\xa0Madison, and James\\xa0Monroe\\nWhig\\n4\\nMillard\\xa0Fillmore, William\\xa0Henry\\xa0Harrison, Zachary\\xa0Taylor, and John\\xa0Tyler[H]\\nFederalist\\n1\\nJohn\\xa0Adams\\nNational Union\\n1\\nAndrew\\xa0Johnson[I]\\nNo party\\n1\\nGeorge\\xa0Washington\\nThe following timeline depicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of\\nassuming office.\\nTimeline of presidents\\n'] [[-0.0071491   0.02242036 -0.0228122  ... -0.00868729  0.01273941\n",
