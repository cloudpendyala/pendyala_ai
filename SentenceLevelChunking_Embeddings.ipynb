McClellan and soldiers at\\nAntietam on October 3, 1862\\nOne of the most important of executive powers is the president\\'s role as\\ncommander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The power to declare\\nwar is constitutionally vested in Congress, but the president has ultimate\\nresponsibility for the direction and disposition of the military. The exact degree\\nof authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander-in-\\nchief has been the subject of much debate throughout history, with Congress at\\nvarious times granting the president wide authority and at others attempting to\\nrestrict that authority.[88] The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the\\npresident\\'s powers regarding the military; Alexander Hamilton explained this\\nin Federalist No. 69:\\nThe President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the\\nUnited States.\\xa0... It would amount to nothing more than the supreme\\ncommand and direction of the military and naval forces\\xa0... while that\\n[the power] of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and\\nto the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all [of]\\nwhich\\xa0 ... would appertain to the legislature.[89] [Emphasis in the\\noriginal.]\\nIn the modern era, pursuant to the War Powers Resolution, Congress must\\nauthorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that\\nhave never been employed, rendering it ineffectual.[90] Additionally, Congress provides a check to presidential\\nmilitary power through its control over military spending and regulation. Presidents have historically initiated the\\nprocess for going to war,[91][92] but critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents\\ndid not get official declarations, including Theodore Roosevelt\\'s military move into Panama in 1903,[91] the Korean\\nWar,[91] the Vietnam War,[91] and the invasions of Grenada in 1983[93] and Panama in 1989.[94]\\nThe amount of military detail handled personally by the president in wartime has varied greatly.[95] George\\nWashington, the first U.S. president, firmly established military subordination under civilian authority. In 1794,\\nWashington used his constitutional powers to assemble 12,000 militia to quell the Whiskey Rebellion, a conflict in\\nWestern Pennsylvania involving armed farmers and distillers who refused to pay an excise tax on spirits. According\\nto historian Joseph Ellis, this was the \"first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field\",\\nthough James Madison briefly took control of artillery units in defense of Washington, D.C., during the War of\\n1812.[96] Abraham Lincoln was deeply involved in overall strategy and in day-to-day operations during the\\nAmerican Civil War, 1861–1865; historians have given Lincoln high praise for his strategic sense and his ability to\\nselect and encourage commanders such as Ulysses S. Grant.[97]\\nThe present-day operational command of the Armed Forces is delegated to the Department of Defense and is\\nnormally exercised through the secretary of defense. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant\\nCommands assist with the operation as outlined in the presidentially approved Unified Command Plan\\n(UCP).[98][99][100]\\nproduces:\\nThe president has the power to nominate federal judges, including members of the United States courts of appeals\\nand the Supreme Court of the United States. However, these nominations require Senate confirmation before they\\nmay take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the\\nfederal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance.

Presidents may\\nalso grant pardons and reprieves. Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon a\\nmonth after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving\\noffice, like when Bill Clinton pardoned Patty Hearst on his last day in office;\\nthis is often controversial.[101][102][103]\\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the\\npresident to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is\\nexecutive privilege, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any\\ncommunications made directly to the president in the performance of executive\\nduties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested\\nto see Chief Justice John Jay's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law,\\nWashington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried\\nto use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence\\nto Congress during the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in United\\nStates v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/418/683/) (1974), that executive\\nprivilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution.

Jones,\\n520 U.S. 681 (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/520/681/) (1997), that the privilege also could not be\\nused in civil suits. These cases established the legal precedent that executive privilege is valid, although the exact\\nextent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to\\nradiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those\\nexecutive branch communications that do not involve the president.[104]\\nThe state secrets privilege allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents\\nfrom discovery in legal proceedings if such release would harm national security. Precedent for the privilege arose\\nearly in the 19th century when Thomas Jefferson refused to release military documents in the treason trial of Aaron\\nBurr and again in Totten v.

Reynolds 345 U.S. 1 (https://supreme.jus\\ntia.com/cases/federal/us/345/1/) (1953), where it was held to be a common law evidentiary privilege.[106] Before\\nthe September 11 attacks, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.[107] Since 2001, the\\ngovernment has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances\\ncausing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Mohamed\\nv.

Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president\\nfrom among the top three electoral vote recipients: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and William H.\\nCrawford. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams\\nbeing elected president on the first ballot.[144]\\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president\\nbegins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election.[145] The first presidential\\nand vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as Inauguration Day, were the second terms of President\\nFranklin D.

As a result of the date change, the first term (1933–37) of both men had been shortened by 43 days.[147]\\nBefore executing the powers of the office, a president is required to recite the presidential Oath of Office, found in\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\xa0 8 of the Constitution.
